A lightweight, browser-based scratchpad that instantly syncs text & files between your devices. Built with Bun + Next.js.

## ü§î What does SyncPad solve?

- Needing that one snippet of code from your personal Mac on your work PC.
- Trying to get a URL from your phone to your laptop without emailing yourself.
- Fighting with USB sticks or cloud storage for simple file transfers.
- Using Discord or Slack to send files to yourself.

SyncPad stops all that. It exists only in your browser tab and works instantly across any device on your network. No accounts, no data mining, no third-parties, just a pure utility.

Because god damn, not everything needs to be monetized.

## ‚ú® Features

- Zero setup, with no login or configuration required.
- Real-time synchronization of text and files across all connected devices.
- Drag and drop support for file sharing.
- Privacy-focused: Your data is not stored on any server, it stays between your devices.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Visit [syncpad.pocketarc.com](https://syncpad.pocketarc.com). (@todo: add link to live demo)
   - Alternatively, you can run it locally (see below).
2. Open the same URL on your other device.
3. Start typing or drag files - they'll sync instantly!

## üõ† Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your machine
- Node.js 20+ (for Next.js)

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pocketarc/syncpad.git
cd syncpad

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the project
turbo dev
```

The app will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3050`
- WebSocket Server: `ws://localhost:8080`

## üß™ Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for comprehensive end-to-end testing, covering multi-client synchronization, file uploads, and mobile interactions.

The test runner is configured to automatically start the frontend and backend servers, so you can run tests directly without needing `turbo dev` running in a separate terminal.

## üèó Architecture

SyncPad is built with:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

The application uses a simple pub/sub model where:

1. Each client connects to the WebSocket server.
2. Updates are broadcast to all connected clients.
3. Files are streamed through the WebSocket connection.
